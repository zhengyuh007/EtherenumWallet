# Implement one Casino in Ropsten Blockchain (test ethereum blockchain) 
Note that there is one hidden file called .babelrc (you will get one this file when using truffle or react.js)
the content is below 
{ 
    "presets": ["env", "react"] 
  }
  
And you will need one node_modules that was initialized by truffle or node.js </br>

The codes in windows powershell(or cmd) is below. </br>

#Important commands in PowerShell or CMD

## Powershell:
# In casino file (make sure truffle is installed)
npm init -y
truffle init
npm i -D webpack react react-dom babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-react babel-preset-env css-loader style-loader json-loader web3@0.20.0
npm i -g http-server
code .
# Code solidity (write casino.sol)
# Publish in Ropsten(make sure metamask connect to ropsten), record ABI and address
# Then create file webpack.config.js (source code in config file)
# Create frontend folder(src) and write App.js, index.html, index.js, index.css
# modify package.json (add build: ".." in scripts section)
# and install some plugins (see in webpack-4-tutorial) in PowerShell (some simple commands)
npm run build (this will generate build.js, index.html, main.css in dist folder -> our final frontend files)

# download ipfs and install, add its folder into PATH environment variable
## CMD
ipfs daemon # this will require some easy commands first, just type it and it will remind u to code
## open another CMD, cd into your project folder
ipfs swarm peers
ipfs add -r dist/
# copy last hash number (the hash for dist)
ipfs name publish [your hash]
# this will show published to [web address]: ...
# In chrome brower, navigate to following address and see the final dapp
